        "1. **Document Embedding** - Convert text documents into vector representations using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`\n",
        "2. **Vector Index** - Create a FAISS index for fast similarity search\n",
        "3. **Retrieval** - Find relevant documents based on user queries using cosine similarity\n",
        "4. **Generation** - Use Llama 3.1-8B (via HuggingFace API) to generate answers from retrieved context\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Technologies:\n",
        "- **SentenceTransformers**: Open-source embedding model\n",
        "- **FAISS**: Facebook's similarity search library\n",
        "- **HuggingFace Inference API**: Free LLM access without local model download\n",
        "\n",
        "## Simplifications:\n",
        "- No document chunking (documents are already small)\n",
        "- No authentication required (using free HF inference)\n",
        "- Minimal preprocessing for educational clarity"
